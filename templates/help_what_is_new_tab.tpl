<h2>What is New</h2>

<p>Here's what we have been working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Plugins:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>&#123;trigger_404}</strong> - Trigger a 404 error;</li>
      <li><strong>&#123;trigger_403}</strong> - Trigger a 403 error;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Although the module always depended on CMSMSExt, it didn't enforce the dependency which probably created odd issues with some of its functionality if CMSMSExt was not installed: the dependency is now official and enforced;</li>
</ul>
